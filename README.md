# Local Weather App

A project as part of the FreeCodeCamp syllabus, to create an in-browser weather app to show the userâ€™s location and current weather conditions using a weather API. This weather app uses a different weather icon depending on the current weather and allows the user the toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
